# XIAO ESP32C3 Arduino Sketches / PlatformIO Projects

**Source code that accompanies the February 2023 version of [First Look at the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/xiao/xiao_esp32c3_intro_en.html)**.

## Introduction

The XIAO ESP32C3 is a recent addition to the Seeed Studio XIAO series of diminutive development boards. It is based on the Espressif ESP32-C3 SoC which, unlike other Espressif microcontrollers, has a RISC-V core.

It should be possible to compile each project with PlatformIO, and with currently one exception, in the Arduino IDE and then upload them to the XIAO. There should be no unresolved dependencies. In other words, there should not be any need to install anything other than this repository. To make these sketches self-contained, private copies of all third-party libraries are included. Where a private library is included, only the necessary files were added. Please obtain the full library from the original source if it is to be used in another project.

## Arduino IDE Notes

Arduino sketches must have an `.ino` file name extension and must be contained in a directory that has the same name as the Arduino sketch (excluding the extension). Consequenty the `01_pin_names` project containts a directory named `pin_names` that in turn contains the Arduino sketch `pin_names.ino`. That sketch is basically empty as it is a long comment only. This is not a problem because the Arduino IDE will import all source files found in the sketch directory. The actual code is in `main.cpp` which is the default name of a PlatformIO project.

![Directory tree](images/dir_tree.jpg) 

To compile and then upload the sketch in the Arduino IDE, click on the **File** top menu, click on **Open...**, then navigate to the `pin_names.ino` file and open it with the system file manager.

Private libraries are stored in the subdirectory `xiao_esp32c3_sketches/libraries`.  The Arduino IDE will find libraries in that directory if the `Sketchbook location` in the Arduino Preferences is set to the parent directory, `xiao_esp32c3_sketches`. Details can be found in [libraries/README.md](libraries/README.md).

## PlatformIO Notes

Because of the Arduino sketch naming constraints, the `main.cpp` file of a project is not stored in the `src` directory. To work around this change, a `src_dir` entry is added in the `platformio.ini` file to provide the name of the directory in which `main.cpp` is found. That will be the name of the Arduino sketch as shown here for the `01_pin_names` project. 

```ini
[platformio]
; Make the Arduino IDE happy (.INO file must be in a directory of the same name)
src_dir = pin_names
```

PlatformIO will "convert" the Arduino sketch, but that is of no consequence since it contains only comments.

## List of Projects      

All these projects except for `01_pin_names` control an external LED that is connected to one of the I/O pins of the XIAO ESP32C3.

| Project | Purpose |
| ---     | ---                           |
| **01_pin_names** | Show the content of `pins_arduino.h` |
| **02_blink_led** | Show the use of `digitalWrite` and `delay` |
| **03_button_led** | Show the use of `digitalWrite` and `digitalRead`  |
| **04_web_led** | Show the use of `WiFiServer` |
| **05_async_web_led** | Show the use of `ESPAsyncWebServer` and its [template processing capabilities](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer#template-processing) |
| **06_ble_led** | Show the use of the `ArduinoBLE` library |
| **07_ble_led** | Show the use of the `BLE` library contained in the ESP32 Arduino core |

## Project Notes

### 04_web_led

This project/sketch is not discussed in [First Look at the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/xiao/xiao_esp32c3_intro_en.html). However, `04_web_led` is a C++ version of a similar MicroPython web server script described in [12. MicroPython: Web Controlled LED](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/xiao/xiao_esp32c3_intro_en.html#web). In both cases, the XIAO ESP32C3 runs a Web server that makes it possible to toggle an external LED on and off through a Web interface.
The source code for the [12. MicroPython: Web Controlled LED](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/xiao/xiao_esp32c3_intro_en.html#web) is available here: [upy_web_led.zip]("https://sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/xiao/dnld/upy_web_led.zip").
